This script is to get the timings of chord simulation on SimGrid. Just copy 
this 2 scripts on examples/msg/chord/ and run ./testall.sh
Logs with timings will be s-copied on log/ folder on rennes.g5k:~/ 
One can use this test to measure time of standar version vs. optimized
version, or without benchmark vs. w/benchmarks ;)
