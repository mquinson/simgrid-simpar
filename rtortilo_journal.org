#+STARTUP: logdone
* May
** 13 [100%]
   - [X] Read Simix and section 3 of the paper
** 14 [100%]
   - [X] Revisit Orgmode emacs (no more vim orgmode)
   - [X] Revisit Tutorials, deploy,platform, play w/code
   - [X] Read Simix code, try to understand the main parts of it.
** 15 [100%]
   - [X] understand how to run experiment.
** 16 [100%]
   - [X] Figure out how to get the times of the previous exp. (system time, in log folder)
   - [X] deploy a parapluie node in rennes. Somehow it refuses to give me a node there, so I got a parapide node. Its not the same, but at least I am able to run the simulation.
   - [X] Install newer version of simgrid. I struggled a lot here, since it seems there are some files missing in examples/msg/chord/ and examples/platform/
   - [X] Figure out how to run with different ammount of threads --cfg flag for simgrid simulations


** 19 [100%]
   - [X] Figure out how to run all the experiments using a script
   - [X] Schedule a Launch with all the experiments. Run in parapluie-9.rennes.grid5000.fr

** 20 [100%] 
   - [X] Run simulation in G5K, using the last version available of [[https://gforge.inria.fr/projects/simgrid/][simgrid]]
	 Anyway, the simulation was too slow, couldnt finish it. Had some unexpected exceptions too.

** 21 [100%]
   - [X] Run te experiment available at revision 918d6192, but with the newer revision. NOTE: this didnt work, the script to run the experiment is simpler than the one I actually need
   - [X] Run modified script on the older version and see what happens
   - [X] Run the scripts of 2011_parallel on the older version and see what happens
   - [X] Run the scripts of 2011_parallel on the newer version and see what happens. Still slower than the paper, at least in constant sequential mode.
** 22 [100%] Simulation is slow, even with the same parameters (like the older version). 
   - [X] Try with other runtime options, lile --cfg=config
   - [X] Try to figure out what the bottleneck is
   - [X] Learn to use FlameGraph
** 23 [100%]
   - [X] read and write down simix things
   - [X] try to use perf to understand performance ussues

     
** 26 [100%]
   - [X] Read and write down things about thread synchronization.
** 27 [100%]
   - [X] profilers: poor man profiler, perf, gprof.
   - [X] learn about thread synchronization.

** 28 [100%]
   - [X] Profiling to find bottleneck in simulation (poorman's, perf, gprof, flamegraph)
    
* June
** 2 - 6 SUD'14

** 10 [100%]
   - [X] Make script to test performance on different versions.
   - [X] Start tests performance in different versions of SG, using a "bisection" methodology.

To run (old) performance regression test: ./SGXP.pl --site=nancy --cluster=graphene --test=chord,goal --rev="e32a2a561ef184dc9ef8cdaf25759bba6b2ea198,71c9241aa27344f9f8f02f3c1272af4556691713,f95108e7e5bcb66bba76a24c1c433eee710e38e0"

** 12 [100%]
   - [X] Performances timings of dynamic threshold algorithm.

*** TODO Find the ifndef/define of the benchmarks that are already done
*** TODO Set up everything to run tests and gather data (with chord, for example)
*** TODO The graph 1: Y=% of scheduling rounds taking #proc. x=#proc
*** TODO The graph 2: Y=number of scheduling round. x=Time (is the time of each scheduling round).
** TODO Amdhal: Optimal Ahmdal threshold: make measures of the application with and without benchmarking (benchmark measuring time of sequential parts of the code and parallel parts of the code. Sum both of them and get total time. Check that total time is the same as without benchmarking). Thats for say that my measurings doesnt affect the performance. After that, benchmark the sequential parts and the parallel parts of the code

* Useful info:
** To run classical chord experiment

   - Steps to connect to G5K and deploy SimGrid:
     1) connect to G5k, connect to Rennes, try to ask a parapluie node:
       oarsub -p "cluster='parapluie'" -l nodes=5,walltime=2 -I -t deploy
     2) apt-get update && apt-get install cmake make gcc git libboost-dev libgct++ libpcre3-dev linux-tools gdb liblua5.1-0-dev
     3) copy simgrid from Rennes frontend
     4) cmake -Denable_compile_optimizations=ON -Denable_supernovae=OFF -Denable_compile_warnings=OFF -Denable_debug=OFF -Denable_gtnets=OFF -Denable_jedule=OFF -Denable_latency_bound_tracking=OFF -Denable_lua=OFF -Denable_model-checking=OFF -Denable_smpi=OFF -Denable_tracing=OFF .
     5) make && make install && sudo chmod 777 /usr/local/lib/libsimgrid.so.<version_number>
     6) to run test, this should work:  ./testall.sh path/to/simgrid/ 3.11
     7) example run: ./chord One_cluster_nobb_1000_hosts.xml chord1000.xml --log=root.thres:critical --cfg=contexts/stack_size:16 --cfg=contexts/guard_size:0 --cfg=network/model:Constant --cfg=network/latency_factor:0.1
     8) Dont forget to modify script to copy logs to home folder (otherwise they will lay on the node, and they will be erased)
     9) To copy something from rennes to the deployed node: scp -r rtortilopez@rennes.grid5000.fr:path/to/file . 
** Profilers:
    1) perf record ./chord ...
    2) perf record -g -e cpu-clock ./chord and then:
    3) perf script | stackcollapse-perf.pl | flamegraph.pl > myapp.svg
    4) script gdb poorman profiler of Gabriel | stackcollapse-gdb.pl | flamegraph.pl > myapp.svg
    5) To copy from node to laptop: scp root@<node_number>.rennes.grid:~/SimGrid/examples/msg/chord/myapp.svg .
    6) poor man's profiler
    7) try with compilation flag -fno-omit-frame-pointer
** To run SG-PRT (Performance regression test):
repository: git+ssh://rtortilo@scm.gforge.inria.fr//gitroot/simgrid/simgrid-perf-reg-tests.git
1) set up a node somewhere.
2) apt-get update && apt-get install cmake make gcc git libboost-dev libgct++ libpcre3-dev linux-tools gdb r-base ruby gem . If possible, gem install rserve-client
3) To install libraries of R, use script download_r_packages.sh
4) Start Rserve daemon in R (library(Rserve); Rserve())
5) set number of commits wanted to analyze in SG-PRT.rb
6) ./SG-PRT.rb

* Paper
** Problem Analysis
  1) Optimal threshold for Amdhal. Which portion of the problem is paralellizable. Which not. Why is hard?(a)
     Two graphics: #SD vs. #process (b) && #SD vs. time(SD) (c)

** Find threshold between sequential/parallel
  1) test over real runs. not simulations (what would be real runs?)
  2) geometric mean (of..)
Once I get the basis threshold:
  3) adaptative algorithm to choose how many threads wake up in each round:
     This is what is already done (smx_ctx_*_runall):
        * if #proc<threshold  --> sequential
        * elif #proc>threshold  --> parallel
     Change threshold dinamically:
     There are timers already defined in the code, but they are not used to do this:
     * if #proc<thresh -->  sequential exec. (chrono) and then seq_time += chrono; seq_amount += #proc;
     * else ------------->  parallel exec. (crhono) and then par_time+=chrono; par_amount+=#proc;
     After 5 sched round:
                (a)                     (b)
     * if seq_time/seq_amount > par_time/par_amount THEN --thresh (c - coeff x a/b)
     * else ++thres
  4) parallel threshold of parmap in cache?
  5) Fast Init: save threshold on disk?

SimGrid3.10

** Optimizations
  1) 
  2) implement parmap between N cores: maestroawake+(N-1)(default?); maestrosleep+(N)(how to sleep master. Check line where master work with its minions and then comment that line? that way master will not work?); maestro sleep+(N-1) (each one of those with busy waiters, futex and posix threads) #proc. (1-5 --> sequential; 6-20 --> 4busy waiters; 20-inf --> 16 busy waiter).
  3) parmap next. Not now.
  4) busy waiters with different #proc. (1-5 --> sequential; 6-20 --> 4busy waiters; 20-inf --> 16 busy waiter).
     Speedup is the same as parallel?
  Performance regression testing
  
** Hot topics task 5
1) we are near amdhal paralelism threshold, because there are no more things to paralellize.
2) we want to run in parallel not only the threads but also the events in each thread?
3) we want to find the independent events and run them in parallel.
